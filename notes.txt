virtual service finds destination based on the host present in both. 
Virtual service matches the host that is present under destination and host in destination rule.
If you give a short name like grafana, Istio assumes: grafana.<same-namespace>.svc.cluster.local
Flow
gateway -> virtual service -> destination rules -> service

Meaning of tls.mode
#DISABLE → No TLS, traffic is plaintext.
#SIMPLE → TLS is used, but no client certs (like HTTPS without mutual auth).
#MUTUAL → mTLS with manually provided certs (you specify clientCertificate, privateKey, caCertificates).
#ISTIO_MUTUAL → mTLS using Istio-managed certs (auto-generated, rotated by Istio CA).
